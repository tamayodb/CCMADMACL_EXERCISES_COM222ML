# Advanced Machine Learning — Colab Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Google Colab notebooks developed throughout the **Advanced Machine Learning** course. The exercises explore key concepts and algorithms in modern machine learning, particularly focusing on unsupervised learning techniques and pattern discovery in data.

## What’s Inside?

Across the notebooks, you’ll find practical implementations of:
- Clustering algorithms like **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**
- Dimensionality reduction using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Association rule learning through methods such as **Apriori** and **FP-Growth**

Each notebook is hands-on and designed to reinforce theoretical lessons with code-based experimentation and visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**, **mlxtend**

## Purpose

These exercises aim to deepen understanding of core machine learning methodologies through real-world datasets, visual analysis, and performance evaluation.
